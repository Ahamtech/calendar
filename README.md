Kalends is a date and time library for Elixir. The only Elixir library with with accurate, up-to-date time zone information.

**kalends |ˈkalɪndz|**
_plural noun_ -
the first day of the month in the ancient Roman calendar. Agner Krarup Erlang was born on the first day of January 1878.

The Olson/Eggert "Time Zone Database" is used. Years 1 through 2200
are supported.

## Getting started

Add Kalends as a dependency to an Elixir project by adding it to your mix.exs file:

```elixir
    defp deps do
      [  {:kalends, "~> 0.6.0"},  ]
    end
```

Then run `mix deps.get` which will fetch Kalends via the hex package manager.

You can then call Kalends functions like this: `Kalends.DateTime.now_utc`. But in order to avoid typing Kalends all the time you can add `use Kalends` to your modules. This aliases Kalends modules such as DateTime and Date. Which means that you can call for instance `DateTime.now_utc` without writing `Kalends.` Example:

```elixir
    defmodule NewYearsHttpLib do
      use Kalends

      def httpdate_new_years(year) do
        {:ok, dt} = DateTime.from_erl({{year,1,1},{0,0,0}}, "Etc/UTC")
        DateTime.Format.httpdate(dt)
      end

      # Calling httpdate_new_years(2015) will return
      # "Thu, 01 Jan 2015 00:00:00 GMT"
    end
```

## Usage examples

For these example first either alias DateTime with this command: `alias Kalends.DateTime` or for use within a module add `use Kalends` to the module.

Get a DateTime struct for the 4th of October 2014 at 23:44:32 in the city of
Montevideo:

```elixir
    {:ok, mvd} = DateTime.from_erl {{2014,10,4},{23,44,32}}, "America/Montevideo"
    {:ok, %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "UYT", day: 4, hour: 23, min: 44, month: 10,
                            sec: 32, std_off: 0, timezone: "America/Montevideo",
                            utc_off: -10800, year: 2014}}
```

A DateTime struct is now assigned to the variable `mvd`. Let's get a DateTime
struct for the same time in the London time zone:

```elixir
    london = mvd |> DateTime.shift_zone! "Europe/London"
    %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "BST", day: 5, hour: 3, min: 44, month: 10,
                      sec: 32, std_off: 3600, timezone: "Europe/London",
                      utc_off: 0, year: 2014}
```

...and then in UTC:

```elixir
    london |> DateTime.shift_zone! "Etc/UTC"
    %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "UTC", day: 5, hour: 2, min: 44, month: 10,
                   sec: 32, std_off: 0, timezone: "Etc/UTC", utc_off: 0, year: 2014}
```

Formatting a DateTime using "strftime":

```elixir
    mvd |> DateTime.Format.strftime! "The day is %A. The time in 12 hour notation is %I:%M:%S %p"
    "The day is Saturday. The time in 12 hour notation is 11:44:32 PM"
```

Transforming a DateTime to a string in ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 format:

```elixir
    mvd |> DateTime.Format.rfc3339
    "2014-10-04T23:44:32-03:00"
```

Parsing the same string again back into a DateTime:

```elixir
    DateTime.Parse.rfc3339 "2014-10-04T23:44:32-03:00", "America/Montevideo"
    {:ok, %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "UYT", day: 4, hour: 23, min: 44,
            month: 10, sec: 32, std_off: 0, timezone: "America/Montevideo",
            utc_off: -10800, year: 2014}}
```

Format as a unix timestamp:

```elixir
    mvd |> DateTime.Format.unix
    1412477072
```

Parsing an RFC 3339 timestamp as UTC:

```elixir
    DateTime.Parse.rfc3339_utc "2014-10-04T23:44:32.4999Z"
    {:ok, %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "UTC", day: 4, usec: 499900, hour: 23,
            min: 44, month: 10, sec: 32, std_off: 0, timezone: "Etc/UTC",
            utc_off: 0, year: 2014}}
```

The time right now for a specified time zone:

```elixir
    cph = DateTime.now "Europe/Copenhagen"
    %Kalends.DateTime{abbr: "CEST", day: 5, hour: 21,
     min: 59, month: 10, sec: 24, std_off: 3600, timezone: "Europe/Copenhagen",
     utc_off: 3600, year: 2014}
```

Transform a DateTime struct to an Erlang style tuple:

```elixir
    cph |> DateTime.to_erl
    {{2014, 10, 5}, {21, 59, 24}}
```

## Documentation

Documentation can be found at http://hexdocs.pm/kalends/

## Ecto

If you want to use Kalends with Ecto, there is a library for that:
Kalecto https://github.com/lau/kalecto

## Raison d'être

There are many different rules for time zones all over the world and they change
often. In order to correctly find out what time it is around the world, the
"tz database" is invaluable. This is (AFAIK) the first pure Elixir library that
uses the tz database correctly and can easily be updated whenever a new version
is released.

## Known bugs

There are no confirmed bugs as this is written. But if you do find a problem,
